It provides an end to end latency measurment between any two ziti identities in
a ziti network and like icmp ping will provide the following metrics upon completion
of the ping session: min, max and mean latency and standard deviation as well as % loss.
zping uses the addressable terminator function of ziti to direct ping requests to
specific ziti identities.`,
